# Linked Lists 
***What is a Linked List ?***

A Linked List is a  sequence of Nodes that are connected/linked to each other. 

 and its  linear data structures, which means that there is a sequence and an order to how they are constructed and traversed   
 - Each element in linked list call node  contains two items:     
 1. the data stored   
 2. link to the next node

***Types of Linked Lists:***    
There are three types of linked lists:

**_Singly Linked Lists_:** Each node contains only one pointer to the next node. This is what we have been talking about so far.     
**_Doubly Linked Lists_:**     
 Each node contains two pointers, a pointer to the next node and a pointer to the previous node.    
**_Circular Linked Lists:_**  
 Circular linked lists are a variation of a linked list in which the last node points to the first node or any other node before it, thereby forming a loop.


 **Basic Operations** 

 Insertion − Adds an element at the beginning of the list.

Deletion − Deletes an element at the beginning of the list.

Display − Displays the complete list.

Search − Searches an element using the given key.

Delete − Deletes an element using the given key.    


## The Big O
Big O Notation is a way of evaluating the performance of an algorithm.    
when we talking  about Big O we have to take into consideration    :
   amount of time that a function, action, or algorithm takes to run based on how many elements we pass to that function.    

**some common types of time complexities in Big O Notation.**

O(1) - Constant time complexity   
O(n) - Linear time complexity   
O(log n) - Logarithmic time complexity   
O(n^2) - Quadratic time complexity
