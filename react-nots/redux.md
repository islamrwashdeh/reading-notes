# REDUX
Redux provides a solid, stable, and mature solution to managing state in your React application. Through a handful of small, useful patterns, Redux can transform your application from a total mess of confusing and scattered state, into a delightfully organized, easy to understand modern JavaScript powerhouse.

The principles of Redux aren't new, but they are packaged and presented for you in an easy to use a library that not only elevates your applications but also improves your general understanding of building JavaScript UIs.

In this course, Dan Abramov will show you the fundamentals of Redux, so that you can start using it to simplify your applications.

## What is Redux?
Redux takes away some of the hassles faced with state management in large applications. It provides you with a great developer experience, and makes sure that the testability of your app isn’t sacrificed for any of those.

As you develop React applications, you may find that keeping all your state in a top-level component is no longer sufficient for you.

You may also have a lot of data changing in your application over time.

## Why use Redux?
Redux itself is a standalone library that can be used with any UI layer or framework, including React, Angular, Vue, Ember, and vanilla JS. Although Redux and React are commonly used together, they are independent of each other.

If you are using Redux with any kind of UI framework, you will normally use a "UI binding" library to tie Redux together with your UI framework, rather than directly interacting with the store from your UI code.

React Redux is the official Redux UI binding library for React. If you are using Redux and React together, you should also use React Redux to bind these two libraries.

## When to use Redux
Lately one of the biggest debates in the frontend world has been about Redux. Not long after its release, Redux became one of the hottest topics of discussion. Many favored it while others pointed out issues.

Redux allows you to manage your app’s state in a single place and keep changes in your app more predictable and traceable. It makes it easier to reason about changes occurring in your app. But all of these benefits come with tradeoffs and constraints. One might feel it adds up boilerplate code, making simple things a little overwhelming; but that depends upon the architecture decisions.

One simple answer to this question is you will realize for yourself when you need Redux. If you’re still confused as to whether you need it, you don’t. This usually happens when your app grows to the scale where managing app state becomes a hassle; and you start looking out for making it easy and simple.
