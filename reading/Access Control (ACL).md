# Access Control (ACL)

__1. **5 steps to RBAC**__

**RBAC** is the idea of assigning system access to users based on their role in an organization. It's important to remember that not every employee needs a starring role.   

**Benefits of RBAC :**
-  assignment of access rights becomes systematic and repeatable  
- much easier to audit user rights, and to correct any issues identified  
-  make the ongoing management of access rights much easier and more secure.

**RBAC implementation**

1. Inventory your systems
2. Analyze your workforce and create roles
3. Assign people to roles
4. Never make one-off change
5. Audit



**Three primary rules are defined for RBAC:**
1. Role assignment: A subject can exercise a permission only if the subject has selected or been assigned a role.    
2. Role authorization: A subject's active role must be authorized for the subject.    

3. Permission authorization: A subject can exercise a permission only if the permission is authorized for the subject's active role. 

**Standardized levels**

The NIST/ANSI/INCITS RBAC standard (2004) recognizes three levels of RBAC:[6]

1. core RBAC 
2. hierarchical RBAC, which adds support for inheritance between roles
3. constrained RBAC, which adds separation of duties
